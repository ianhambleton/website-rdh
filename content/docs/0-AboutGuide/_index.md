## The goals of the guide
We have designed this guide to help researchers manage their research data. Many of the concepts we introduce and discuss are relevant to many research disciplines and also to other types of information - such as University administrative data. 

The guide is part book and part training course. At the start of each page we list the practical resources relevant to the page, and the training materials available for download. The guide is linked to an associated instructor-led training course, and we plan to offer offer this course at regular intervals during the academic calendar. <mark>You can view our training schedule here.</mark>

You can think of the guide as self-paced learning resource, and the associated course as a more formal, and more interactive, online training opportunity. This guide is the companion text to our online course.

If you follow this guide from start to finish, you will travel through the research data lifecycle from planning, collecting, and processing data, to analysing, preserving, sharing and (ultimately) re-using data resources. 
The whole guide could be covered in about 4 half-day sessions, but it has a modular design, and you can hop on and off at any time.

An ultimate goal of the guide and associated training is to help you to make your research data resources Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). <mark>You can read more about the FAIR data principles here.</mark>

We have drawn extensively from a number of international data-handling sources. <mark>Those sources are listed here.</mark> Just as important, we have been working with research data for our entire (and now pretty long!) research careers. We have drawn on this experience to bring you a guide that reflects much of the current best-practice among research data handlers worldwide.

There are great examples of best-practice data-handling across the Caribbean, and As much as possible, we draw on Caribbean data examples

### Selvi Jeyaseelan
<i>PhD-level Research Manager.</i>  Selvi is a clinical trialist by training and has worked in health research for over twenty years. She has worked in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean, variously for the University of Manchester, The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and The University of the West Indies. Selvi has experience in the design and conduct of a range of study designs from randomized clinical trials to population surveys. During her time as part of an academic team (2000-2007) she secured over Â£5 million in funding. Since moving to the Caribbean, Selvi has secured a further 1 million US dollars of funding for health-related research.
